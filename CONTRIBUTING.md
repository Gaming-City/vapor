Contributions are welcome.

You can either open a pull request or open an issue if you have an idea.

There are 2 main branches
- `master` - used for stable releases
- `develop` - used for active development

Feature branches should be created from the `develop` branch.

Hotfix branches should be created from the `master` branch.

I reserve the right to either decline or rewrite your pull request.
