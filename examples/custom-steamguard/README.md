# Vapor Example - Custom SteamGuard

This example demonstrates the possibility of plugging in a custom function which handles SteamGuard code retrieval automatically. Well, almost... :grinning:

Once you have this example running, it will end with login error. This is correct since the auth code provided directly in the code is expected to fail.

Notice the config object which contains `stdinSteamGuard` property set to `false`.

### Usage

```sh
VAPOR_USER=username VAPOR_PASS=password node index.js
```

Replace `username` and `password` with real values.
