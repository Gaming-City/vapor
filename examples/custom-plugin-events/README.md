# Vapor Example - Custom Plugin Events

Example of cross-plugin communication using custom events. Notice the importance of plugin names which are used to identify the event emitter.

This example was originally in the Wiki.

### Usage

```sh
VAPOR_USER=username VAPOR_PASS=password node index.js
```

Replace `username` and `password` with real values.
