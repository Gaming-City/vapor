# Vapor Example - Basic

Simple example which demonstrates how to make a pretty basic bot.

This example also contains full config object which contains every single available property. Other examples contain only subset of config properties and everything else is set to default.

### Usage

```sh
VAPOR_USER=username VAPOR_PASS=password node index.js
```

Replace `username` and `password` with real values.
