# Vapor Example - Hello World

"Hello World!" type of example. :grinning:

This is pretty much the simplest plugin one can make.

This example shows:
* that you can set the `servers` property to use up-to-date list of Steam servers
* that `init` and `use` methods can also be chained

### Usage

```sh
VAPOR_USER=username VAPOR_PASS=password node index.js
```

Replace `username` and `password` with real values.
